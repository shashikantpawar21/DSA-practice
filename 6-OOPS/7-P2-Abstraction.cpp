// Certainly, let me provide a simpler explanation:

// Abstraction:

// What it does: Abstraction helps in simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features and ignoring unnecessary details.
// How it works: It involves creating classes that represent real-world entities and exposing only the relevant information and behaviors.
// Example: If you have a Car class, you might only expose methods like start() and drive() without revealing every technical detail of how the car's engine works.
// Encapsulation:

// What it does: Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class).
// How it works: It hides the internal details of how things are implemented and provides a controlled way (through methods) to interact with the data.
// Example: In a BankAccount class, you may hide the balance attribute and provide methods like deposit() and withdraw() to control how money is managed.
// Difference:

// Abstraction is about simplifying and focusing on essential features, like providing a high-level view.
// Encapsulation is about bundling related things together and controlling access to them.
// Analogy:

// Think of abstraction as using a TV remote. You don't need to know how the remote sends signals to the TV; you just press buttons to get the desired result. That's abstraction.
// Now, encapsulation is like the remote's casing. It protects the internal electronics, and you interact with it through well-defined buttons. The details inside are hidden from you.
// In programming terms, abstraction lets you design classes with essential features, while encapsulation helps in keeping those features organized and controlled. Together, they make code more manageable and understandable.

// What comes first while solving a problem abstraction or encapsulation 
// ChatGPT
// The decision of whether to prioritize abstraction or encapsulation first when solving a problem depends on the specific problem context and your design preferences. However, in object-oriented programming, both abstraction and encapsulation often go hand in hand and are interrelated.

// Abstraction:

// When to prioritize it first:
// If the problem involves defining the essential features, behaviors, or relationships between entities.
// If you need to create a high-level view of the system, focusing on what needs to be done rather than how it's done.
// Why it's important:
// Abstraction helps you model real-world entities in a simplified manner, making the problem more manageable.
// Encapsulation:

// When to prioritize it first:
// If the problem involves organizing data and methods into a coherent structure.
// If you want to hide the internal details and implementation complexities to achieve data security and controlled access.
// Why it's important:
// Encapsulation provides a way to bundle related data and methods, promoting modularity and preventing unintended interference with internal details.
// Typical Approach:

// In practice, many developers follow an iterative approach where abstraction and encapsulation are developed simultaneously.
// You might start by identifying key entities and defining abstract classes or interfaces (abstraction). At the same time, you'll decide how to organize the data and methods within these classes to achieve encapsulation.
// Refinement of both abstraction and encapsulation occurs as you gain a deeper understanding of the problem and its requirements.
// Example:

// Suppose you're designing a system for a zoo.
// Abstraction: You might start by identifying key entities like Animal and Enclosure, defining their essential features and behaviors.
// Encapsulation: Simultaneously, you organize the data and methods within the Animal class, hiding implementation details and exposing only relevant methods.
// In summary, the choice between prioritizing abstraction or encapsulation first depends on the nature of the problem, but in most cases, they are developed in parallel to create a well-structured and maintainable solution.
